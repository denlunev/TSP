Travelling salesman problem
==================================================
Java Web Application to solve TSP using [Genetic Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)

_The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization studied in operations research and theoretical computer science. Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to find the shortest possible tour where each city is visited only once._
